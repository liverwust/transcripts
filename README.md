Transcripts
===========

Originally, the intention was to automate ingest of recorded files to
Dragon NaturallySpeaking, and to produce actual transcripts of recorded
audio notes. However, the speech-to-text engine doesn't do a good job,
perhaps because of the car noise or just my voice. Instead, the new
goal is to produce "audio transcripts," with car noise reduced and
silence removed.

3.  Start recording; don't worry about leaving silence to think
4.  Stop recording
5.  Later, once off the road, rename & upload the file (e.g., w/ QFile)
6.  Download the file to a computer with Audacity, to /tmp/macro-input
7.  Set up the _Remove Car Noise_ macro to match the included PNG
8.  Run the macro on __Files...__, and select CarNoise.flac (not
    included) first, before any other files
9.  Run the adjust\_mtimes.sh script with no arguments
10. Upload the xx\_processed.ogg files from /tmp/macro-output to NAS
